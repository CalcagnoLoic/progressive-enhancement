## File `exercise` :

### HTML

* The first part of the project is the transformation of a `.txt` file into `.html`.
* The appropriate `tag` was placed in the file to make it accessible.
* Finally `attributes` and `classes` were added. 

### CSS 

* First of all, the font was modified using CSS selectors.
* The box model was used to understand the concepts of border, margin, padding, etc. Various modifications were made. 
* A second part on selectors was done with more complex patterns as well as with classes (`.class`) and IDs (`#ID`).
* The positioning of elements with `display` and `float`.
